# Simon Game

Simon Game is a classic memory game that tests and improves your memory and cognitive skills. It challenges players to remember and repeat a series of random color sequences. The game provides a fun and interactive way to enhance your memory and concentration.

## How to Play

1. The game consists of multiple levels, with each level increasing the complexity and length of the color sequences.

2. The game starts by displaying a color sequence. Pay close attention to the sequence as it will be your task to repeat it.

3. After the sequence is displayed, it is your turn to repeat the sequence by clicking on the colors in the same order.

4. If you successfully repeat the sequence, you advance to the next level. The game will add a new color to the sequence.

5. If you make a mistake and click the wrong color or the wrong order, the game will end, and you will have to start over from the first level.

6. The goal is to reach the highest level possible and achieve the highest score.

7. Enjoy playing the Simon Game and challenging your memory skills!
